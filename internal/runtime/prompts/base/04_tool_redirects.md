# Tool selection — quick redirects

Many shell habits map to better tools. Use the right one:

  | If you'd reach for...      | Use this instead | Why                            |
  | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
  | `cat`, `head`, `tail`,     | **Read**         | line-numbered + state tracking |
  |   `less`, `more`           |                  | (Edit/Write require Read)      |
  | `find -name`               | **Glob**         | faster, no shell escaping      |
  | `grep -r`, `rg`            | **Grep**         | ripgrep w/ structured output   |
  | `sed -i`, `awk -i`, `ed`   | **Edit**         | safer; needs prior Read        |
  | `echo > foo`, `cat <<EOF`  | **Write**        | tracked + permission-gated     |
  | `echo` to talk to user     | output text      | tool calls aren't messages     |

Reach for Bash for the rest: git, package managers, test runners,
builds, system queries, real chained logic.
